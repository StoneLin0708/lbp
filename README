	a lbp feature classifier using svm in opencv

	main function is not done yet,I will finish it some day
	!!! for now it can just run "lbp_svm test" and show a tested image !!!

	lbpFeature.cpp lbpFeatrueSvm.cpp is done and can work

	I rewrite almost all classifier using svm in opencv to classify lbp Feature from picture,
	just wanna know how classifier working,
	the resoult is poor, but I think I write a right program 
	(best result show in git folder)

	This program contain
		1.training data for basic lbp feature
		2.classify using trained file

	Feature
		1.newbie coding
		2.I made basic lbp converter
		3.svm in opencv
		4.it can use pca to reduce traning sample (but made bad classify rate)
